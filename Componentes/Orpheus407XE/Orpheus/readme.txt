==============================================


1. Introduction


Orpheus is an award-winning UI toolkit for Borland Delphi &
C++Builder. It contains over 120 components covering everything from
data entry to calendars and clocks. Other noteworthy components
include an Object Inspector, LookOut bar, & report views.

This is a source-only release of TurboPower Orpheus. It includes
designtime and runtime packages for Delphi 3 through 7 and C++Builder
3 through 6.

==============================================

2. Package names


TurboPower Orpheus package names have the following form:

  ONNN_KVV.*
   |   ||
   |   |+------ VV  VCL version (30=Delphi 3, 35=C++Builder 3, 70=Delphi 7)
   |   +------- K   Kind of package (R=runtime, D=designtime)
   |
   +----------- NNN Product version number (e.g., 406=version 4.06)

For example, the Orpheus runtime package files for Delphi 7 have
the filename O406_R70.*.

The runtime package contains the core functionality of the product and
is not installed into the IDE. The designtime package references the
runtime package, registers the components, and contains property
editors used in the IDE.

==============================================

3. Installation


To install TurboPower Orpheus into your IDE, take the following
steps:

  1. Unzip the release files into a directory (e.g., d:\orpheus).

  2. Start Delphi or C++Builder.

  3. Add the source subdirectory (e.g., d:\orpheus\source) to the
     IDE's library path.

  4. Open & compile the runtime package specific to the IDE being
     used.

  5. Open & install the designtime package specific to the IDE being
     used. The IDE should notify you the components have been
     installed.

==============================================

4. Deprecated components

There is a tab in the component palette called "Orpheus Deprecated",
which contains the older legacy components. As Orpheus evolves and
newer technologies are employed, you should reduce your dependence on
these components. This does not mean that you cannot use them, or that
they are ever going away, just that the emphasis on them is being
diminished as they are replaced with newer, better versions.  For new
projects, you should consider moving away from dependence on these
older style components.
