Revision 49: (2009/11/28 Roman Kassebaum)
- TOvcTCCustomString and with it TOvcTCString uses PString. This means the in the OnGetCellText event handler should look like the following:
  Data := @FString; (with FString: string, not a ShortString or AnsiString).
  This is the first revision that allows to use the TOvcTCString under unicode.

- TOvcTCColHead: Fixed a big problem that occurs if the Ellipsis was shown.
  Previous revisions shouldn't be used any longer.
  
Revision 45: (2009/11/18 Roman Kassebaum)
- Added the new editor TOvcTCCustomInt for Integers. The OnGetCellText event handler should look like the following:
  OvcTCCustomInt1.IntToData(FInteger, Data, Purpose);
  The DoneEdit event handler must be assigned in the following way:
  FInteger := OvcTCCustomInt1.IntegerValue;

Revision 44: (2009/11/18 Roman Kassebaum)
- Added the new editor TOvcTCCustomStr which uses PChar. The OnGetCellText event handler should look like the following:
  OvcTCCustomStr1.StringToData(FString, Data, Purpose);
  Cause the TOvcTCCustomStr uses a PChar, the DoneEdit event handler must be assigned in the following way:
  FString := OvcTCCustomStr1.StringValue;
