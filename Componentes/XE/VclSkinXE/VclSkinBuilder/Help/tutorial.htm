<p><b>1. Skin Fundamentals </b> </p>
<p>The first step in learning skin is to understand how it works. Unlike some 
  apps where you create a mostly static skin, Vclskin must work with the dynamic 
  environment of Windows. The various windows and buttons change shape and size 
  with each program, so Skin must adapt your graphics to each item. It is important 
  to keep this in mind when creating your design. With the code, you are able 
  to set how many pixels of the image around the border, are to be left alone. 
  The rest of the image is then stretched or tiled (as you specify) in order to 
  enlarge or compact the image as needed. </p>
<p><b>2. Image</b></p>
<p><img src="rect.gif" width="483" height="416"></p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Image margins</b>: margin of image that should not be stretched/tiled.<br>
  </li>
  <li><b>Stretch and Tile</b> : image is tiled or stretched.</li>
  <li><b>Transparency</b> : draw the image transparently, Transparent Color is 
    clFuchsia,RGB: 255,000,255, $00FF00FF.</li>
  <li><b>Frame</b> : Image state number.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>3. Windows Border and MainMenu</b></p>
<p><img src="border.gif" width="500" height="500"></p>
<p>There are also two other possible image states: inactive and active window. 
  The active window is the window that is currently being used, while the inactive 
  window is any window(s) that is in the background.</p>

<p><b>4. Title buttons</b></p>

<p><b>5.Button</b></p>
<p> <img src="button.gif" width="471" height="259"></p>
<p>There are five different states for the buttons image, each displayed at a 
  different time.</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Normal: </b>The normal state is what you see when the button is just 
    there, undisturbed.</li>
  <li><b>Pressed:</b> The pressed state is what you see when the button has been 
    clicked and/or the mouse button is being held down with the cursor over the 
    button.</li>
  <li><b>Disabled:</b> This state is visible when the function of the button is 
    not available. For example, when you open a new Internet Explorer window, 
    the back button is not available because you have no webpage to go back to 
    at that time. Therefore, the back button will be displayed with the disabled 
    state.</li>
  <li><b>Focus:</b> The focus state is displayed when the mouse cursor passes 
    over the button.</li>
  <li><b>Default: </b>The default state is displayed.</li>
</ul>
